\begin{defi}
 The \emph{$n$-dimensional affine space} is the set $\Abb^n$ of $n$-tuples with entries in $\Cbb$.
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}
 For an ideal $J\subset \Cbb[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ we define the \emph{zero set $V(J)$ of $J$} as the set of points $p \in \Cbb$. For a subset 
$X\subset \Abb^n$ we define the \emph{ideal $I(V)$ of $X$} as usual.
\end{defi}
